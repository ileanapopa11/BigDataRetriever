      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        BIR- Big Data Retriever is a Web System that is able to query, compare, visualize, share,
        summarize, large sets of data/knowledge and additional resources provided by Wikidata.
  The platform will give the user access to everything that he finds of interest that is available
        in the Wikidata collaboratively edited knowledge base, items and topics ranging from
        1988 Summer Olympics, to love or Elvis Presley. Every item in this valuable collection of data is
  uniquely identified by an unique number, making it possible for the concept to be translated without
  favoring any language. The tool can for this reason easily recommend related information and similar
  resources available in other languages. In the background, data will be processed in a distributed,
  fast and reliable manner, using Hadoop MapReduce.

      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <p>The user connects to the Web Interface of the BIR project, where the topics can be chosen and a query is
      generated, not unlike the tool available <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/hay/vizquery/">here</a>. After the user
      describes the data they are interested in, the input is transformed in a SPARQL query. Wikidata databases are queried
      through the  Sparql endpoint provided and the results are generated in JSON format.</p>

      <h2>External Data Sources</h2>

      <section id="person-org">
        <h3>Wikidata</h3>
        <p>Belonging to the Wikimedia family of websites, alongside the famous Wikipedia, Wikidata is a place that
        stores structured data in many languages. The basic entity stored is an Item and can be a thing, a place,
        a person, an idea or anything else. Each article from Wikipedia corresponds to a Wikidata Item, but there
        are many Wikidata Items that have no Wikipedia pages associated to them.</p>

        <p>All languages are treated the same way because Items are not identified by specific words, but by unique
        identifiers prefixed with the letter Q, known as "QID". This allows the item to be translated without any
        language bias. Also, some items named in the same way can have different meaning, thus being identified by different codes.
        For example, Elvis Presley (Q303) represents the American singer and actor and Elvis Presley (Q610926) represents the self titled album.</p>

        <p>Similarly to items, Wikidata stores a list of Statements associated to an item. Each statement has a Property and a Value, and the Property
        has a generic identifier that starts with P instead of Q. For example the item Q1490 (Tokyo) has associated the value P17 that represents
        "country" in English, "государство" in Russian and so on. The value P17(contry) for Q1490(Tokyo) is Q17(Japan).</p>

        <p>Not all statement have to point to numeric values, for example one of the statements about Tokyo is the flag Q20900820, which points to an
          image of the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Tokyo_Prefecture.svg">Flag of Tokyo Prefecture</a>.</p>

        <p>Data provided by Wikidata can transform into knowledge or interesting facts, as Amir E. Aharoni, that works at Wikimedia Foundation
        pointed out in a Quora answer. In this <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Tokyo_Prefecture.svg">article</a> Buzzfeed came
        up with a list of the 30 most famous people to die each year since 1900.</p>

        <h3>SparQL Endpoint</h3>
        <p>
        The service provided by <a href="https://query.wikidata.org">Wikidata Query Service</a> is used programatically from python by submitting requests to
        https://query.wikidata.org/sparql, as shown in the code below. The requests module handles HTTP requests, runs a SPARQL query and can return the resulted
        data in XML, CSV, JSON or BINARY RDF.

          The user is first presented with a homescreen that displays all the available options:
      </p>

    <p>
        <i>Create query</i> allows the user to create a new query and select either Wikidata, DBPedia or both as the knowledge base.
        The user also has the choice of using either the built-in GUI for creating queries or using <i>advanced syntax</i> in
        order to write the query manually themselves. The results are nevertheless the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Recent</i> shows the 10 previous queries inputed by the user, provided cookies are enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Examples</i> displays a list of possible queries in both simple and advanced syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
        Postprocessing is also available via additional filtering and grouping methods (such as grouping results by country or time spans etc).

      <h2>Conclusions and Improvement</h2>
      <p>BiR set out to be a great visualization and aggregator for Big Data and is shaping up nicely. Its intended purpose is to make exploratory analysis of resources
      such as those provided by Wikidata or DBPedia much easier, and bring new, intuitive and descriptive visual representations to the table.</p>
      <p>
          Using JavaScript and Python, BiR is very lightweight and completely platform-independent; being available on virtually any OS. Full-fledged support for mobile versions
          is in the works as well.
