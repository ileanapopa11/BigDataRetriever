      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        BIR- Big Data Retriever is a Web System that is able to query, compare, visualize, share,
        summarize, large sets of data/knowledge and additional resources provided by Wikidata.
  The platform will give the user access to everything that he finds of interest that is available
        in the Wikidata collaboratively edited knowledge base, items and topics ranging from
        1988 Summer Olympics, to love or Elvis Presley. Every item in this valuable collection of data is
  uniquely identified by an unique number, making it possible for the concept to be translated without
  favoring any language. The tool can for this reason easily recommend related information and similar
  resources available in other languages. In the background, data will be processed in a distributed,
  fast and reliable manner, using Hadoop MapReduce.

    <h2>Roadmap and project progress</h2>
    <h3> Done </h3>
    <p>10 Oct. : Project subject chosen - BIR</p>
    <p>11 Oct. : Created project repo and public page (current page)</p>
    <p>18 Oct. : Started work on Scholarly Report</p>
    <p>19 Oct. : Wrote a basic RESTful API</p>
    <p>19 Oct. : Decided on the underlying technologies to be used</p>
    <p>19 Oct. : Made some basic diagrams for both architecture and use-case scenarios</p>
    <p>24 Oct. : Diagrams done</p>
    <p>25 Oct. : Started research (light reading) on Big Data techniques that might prove helpful</p>
    <p>26 Oct. : Started work on public blog (current page)</p>
    <p>09 Nov. : Wrapped up work on public page, just small adjustments left </p>
    <p>09 Nov. : Reworked one of the diagrams to fit more use-cases </p>
    <p>17 Nov. : Came up with another, more in-depth architecture diagram</p>
    <p>17 Nov. : Decided against using RDF data in favour of JSON</p>
    <p>26 Nov. : Finished Scholarly Report</p>
    <p>26 Nov. : Finished public blog page</p>
    <p>27 Nov. : Uploaded everything we have so far to the github repo</p>
    <p>27 Nov. : Presentation...</p>

    <h3>To be done </h3>
    <p>by 30 Nov. :  Get a small python module that can succesfully query the SparQL endpoint working</p>
    <p>by 06 Dec. : Decide what other knowledge base to use other than Wikidata (DBPedia)</p>
    <p>xy ???. : Implement the backend part</p>
    <p>xy ???. : Implement the frontend part</p>
    <p>xy ???. : Add (and thorougly test) every requested functionality</p>

      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <p>The user connects to the Web Interface of the BIR project, where the topics can be chosen and a query is
      generated, not unlike the tool available <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/hay/vizquery/">here</a>. After the user
      describes the data they are interested in, the input is transformed in a SPARQL query. Wikidata databases are queried
      through the  Sparql endpoint provided and the results are generated in JSON format.</p>

      <h2>User Experience</h2>
      <p> The user can easily create a new query using the GUI, write one using advanced syntax, or choose from various examples and previously-searched queries.
      </p>
      <img src="docs/photos/home.png" style="width: 800px;" alt="home">
      <p> Choosing a simple query provides autocomplete suggestions for items and properties, and displays their internal id. </p>
      <img src="docs/photos/squery.png" style="width: 800px;" alt="simple query">
      <p> The results can be displayed visually with thumbnail images, or as a list. </p>
        <img src="docs/photos/results_grid.png" style="width: 800px;" alt="results grid">
        <p>The results can also be grouped by location, spans of time or other preset filters. </p>
        <img src="docs/photos/results_loc.png" style="width: 800px;" alt="results location">
        <p> The user can also compare the results of the most recent queries with another, newly-inputed one, and have this comparison displayed visually.</p>
