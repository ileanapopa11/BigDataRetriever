# BigDataRetriever Web Application Development (WADe Project)
Progress Page: https://ileanapopa11.github.io/BigDataRetriever/
Official requirements:
There are plenty of interesting resources provided by Wikidata via its SPARQL endpoint. Develop a (micro-)service-based platform able to "intelligently" query, compare, visualize, share, summarize, etc. large (sets of) data/knowledge and additional resources. Also, this Web system will recommend related information and/or similar resources available in other languages. Various computations could be performed by using existing big data techniques and tools. Bonus: the use of natural user interactions.
