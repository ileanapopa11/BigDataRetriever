      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        BIR- Big Data Retriever is a Web System that is able to query, compare, visualize, share,
        summarize, large sets of data/knowledge and additional resources provided by Wikidata.
  The platform will give the user access to everything that he finds of interest that is available
        in the Wikidata collaboratively edited knowledge base, items and topics ranging from
        1988 Summer Olympics, to love or Elvis Presley. Every item in this valuable collection of data is
  uniquely identified by an unique number, making it possible for the concept to be translated without
  favoring any language. The tool can for this reason easily recommend related information and similar
  resources available in other languages. In the background, data will be processed in a distributed,
  fast and reliable manner, using Hadoop MapReduce.

      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <p>The user connects to the Web Interface of the BIR project, where the topics can be chosen and a query is
      generated, similarly with the tool <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/hay/vizquery/">here</a>. After the user
      describes the data he's interested in, this is transformed in a SPARQL query. Wikidata databases are queried
      through the  Sparql endpoint provided and the results are generated in JSON format.</p>

        <h3>MapReduce</h3>
        <p>
          Hadoop distributes the data as it is initially stored in the system. Many nodes work in parallel,
          each on their own part of the overall dataset. While preparing the data, extracting knowledge from it
          and making relevant suggestions based on the user's interests, this Big Data approach can tackle problems
          like <it>Graph creation and analysis</it> and <it>Pattern Recognition</it> that proves to be meaningful for
          the problem at hand.

      <h2>External Data Sources</h2>

      <section id="person-org">
        <h3>Wikidata</h3>
        <p>Belonging to the Wikimedia family of websites, alongside the famous Wikipedia, Wikidata is a place that
        stores structured data in many languages. The basic entity stored is an Item and can be a thing, a place,
        a person, an idea or anything else. Each article from Wikipedia corresponds to a Wikidata Item, but there
        are many Wikidata Items that have no Wikipedia pages associated to them.</p>

        <p>All languages are treated the same way because Items are not identified by specific words, but by unique
        identifiers prefixed with the letter Q, known as "QID". This allows the item to be translated without any
        language bias. Also, some items named in the same way can have different meaning, thus being identified by different codes.
        For example, Elvis Presley (Q303) represents the American singer and actor and Elvis Presley (Q610926) represents the self titled album.</p>

        <p>Similarly to items, Wikidata stores a list of Statements associated to an item. Each statement has a Property and a Value, and the Property
        has a generic identifier that starts with P instead of Q. For example the item Q1490 (Tokyo) has associated the value P17 that represents
        "country" in English, "государство" in Russian and so on. The value P17(contry) for Q1490(Tokyo) is Q17(Japan).</p>

        <p>Not all statement have to point to numeric values, for example one of the statements about Tokyo is the flag Q20900820, which points to an
          image of the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Tokyo_Prefecture.svg">Flag of Tokyo Prefecture</a>.</p>

        <p>Data provided by Wikidata can transform into knowledge or interesting facts, as Amir E. Aharoni, that works at Wikimedia Foundation
        pointed out in a Quora answer. In this <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Tokyo_Prefecture.svg">article</a> Buzzfeed came
        up with a list of the 30 most famous people to die each year since 1900.</p>

        <h3>SparQL Endpoint</h3>
        <p>
        The service provided by <a href="https://query.wikidata.org">Wikidata Query Service</a> is used programatically from python by submitting requests to
        https://query.wikidata.org/sparql, as shown in the code below. The requests module handles HTTP requests, runs a SPARQL query and can return the resulted
        data in XML, CSV, JSON or BINARY RDF.

          Equations can be displayed inline or as blocks within a paragaph.

      <h2>User Interaction</h2>
      <p>
        A limited number of classes and properties are currently not available from
        <a role="doc-biblioref">schema.org</a>. In most if not all cases it would be desirable to
        make them available there, but while work is progressing it is simpler to define them
        ourselves.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
        The current URL for the Scholarly Article vocabulary is
        <code>http://ns.science.ai/</code>. It may be desirable (should the vocabulary persist) to
        use a different URL. But this issue might go away if schema.org steps up.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can read the <a href="http://ns.science.ai/">definitions for the SA vocabulary</a>.

      <h2>Conclusions and Improvement</h2>
      <p>
        Scholarly HTML would like to thank <a href="http://scholarlyhtml.org/">Scholarly HTML</a>
        (you read that right) for blazing the trail perhaps a few years too soon. Particularly,
        the following people were particularly kind and helpful:
        <a href="https://twitter.com/ptsefton">Peter Sefton</a>,
        <a href="https://twitter.com/blahah404">Richard Smith-Unna</a>, and
        <a href="https://twitter.com/petermurrayrust">Peter Murray-Rust</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        PLOS has a
        <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/03/19/a-very-brief-history-of-scholarly-html/">short
        history of Scholarly HTML</a> that is worth reading (and would be worth updating).
      </p>
      <p>
        Dan Brickley was kind enough to drop by the office to chat about our usage of
        <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> even though he was tired and hungry. As
        always, examples involving fish tanks are the most helpful. Dave Cramer shared ideas
        that we happily stole.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patrick Johnston’s input has been crucial, notably in modeling authoring. We can only
        hope that getting those details exactly right have not caused him to lose too much
        sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also received very useful feedback and pointers from: Kjetil Kjernsmo (DAHUT!),
        Silvio Peroni, Justin Johansson, Alf Eaton, Raniere Silvia, Kaveh Bazargan and Mike
        Smith. We are very much indebted to the help provided us by Ivan Herman.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we somehow forgot you in this list and you are too gracious to complain, we love you
        all the same.
